## About
This repository was created to keep track of my experiments while participating in Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's 2023 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship. It is intended to be private and solely for the reference of those involved in the project.

## Branches
There will be a new branch for each phase of development. `main` will only contain the latest, most successful version of the code.

## Dependencies
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `deepxde`
- `pytorch` (or other suitable machine learning framework, backend for `deepxde`)
- `scipy`
